- change server status to "Stopping" when stopped
  - make stop button disabled or have a spinner when stopping
- toast from top when saving server properties
- restarting alert doesn't update when the server is actually running again
  - (maybe start an interval to fetch server info every 5 seconds, clear interval when done restarting?)
- update all packages
- remove all this CA crap
- mock stripe when running locally
- stop using sqlite and just use postgres
- prevent server entry from re-creating if the server is deleted from sql
