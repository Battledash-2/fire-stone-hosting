- refactor to typescript
- remove all this CA crap
- redux toolkit instead of redux
- ability to create an account without buying
- mock stripe when running locally
- force new account before purchase a server
- put backend api routes in a routes file
- look into why it is only remove servers one at a time when I delete them from the DB
- stop using sqlite and just use postgres
- rename node to agent
- rename server to MinecraftContainer
- agent should register with master when started
- maybe use MQ for starting and stopping servers instead of polling?
- prevent server entry from re-creating if the server is deleted from sql
